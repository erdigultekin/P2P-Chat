P2P Chat Project

# 1.Project Summary
P2P Chat application is written with Java programming language and it aims to provide a peer-to-peer messaging solution. 

# 2.Solution Approach
P2P Chat application consist of 2 parts. First is the peer program and the other one is the registrar program. Users are using the peer program to register their usernames, login to the system and search other users. After finding IP address and port number of any other user in the registration system, they can send request to them to start a chat.
Registrar program is responsible for keeping track of the registered users, their passwords, connection information (IP address and port) and online status. To make the testing easy with a single computer, it is assumed that both the registrar and the peer will be run on the “localhost” and it can be changed from the peer and registrar.
